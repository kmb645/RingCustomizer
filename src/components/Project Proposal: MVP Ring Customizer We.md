Project Proposal: MVP Ring Customizer Web Application (Hourly Engagement)
Prepared For: [Client Name]
Prepared By: [Your Name/Company Name]
Platform: Upwork
Hourly Rate: $24/hour
Proposed Timeline: 30-35 Working Days
Estimated Weekly Hours: 32-40 hours
Estimated Total Investment: ~$3,840 - $5,760 (Based on 160-240 total hours)
1. Project Overview
This proposal outlines an hourly engagement for the development of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a Ring Customizer web application, to be delivered within a 30-35 working day timeframe. The goal is to build a core, functional prototype inspired by the user experience of sites like Blue Nile, focusing on the essential flow of selecting a ring setting, choosing a diamond, and seeing a final price.
2. Scope of Work (MVP Features)
The work will be focused exclusively on delivering the following core features within the timeline:
Main Landing Page: Featuring one pre-defined ring setting.
Customization Interface: A split-panel UI with a diamond selector (filterable by Carat and Price) and a preview area with a rotatable 3D model.
Real-Time Price Calculator: A summary bar that updates the total price instantly.
"Add to Cart" Button: A visual placeholder for the final call-to-action.
Fully Responsive Design: For desktop, tablet, and mobile.
Explicitly Out of Scope for this Timeline:
Advanced diamond filters (cut, color, clarity).
Dynamic 3D material swapping.
User accounts, saved designs, or checkout integration.
Payment processing.
3. Work Schedule & Hourly Commitment
To achieve the 30-35 day goal, I propose the following work schedule:
Working Days: 30-35 days (6-7 weeks).
Weekly Commitment: 32-40 hours per week dedicated to your project.
Total Estimated Hours: 160 - 240 hours (A more accurate estimate will be possible after the initial setup phase).
Estimated Total Cost: $3,840 - $5,760 (160-240 hours @ $24/hr).
This dedicated, full-time equivalent commitment ensures focused effort and timely delivery.
4. Technical Approach
Framework: Next.js 14 with TypeScript.
Styling: Tailwind CSS.
State Management: React Context API.
3D Visualization: React Three Fiber (R3F) for a static, rotatable 3D model.
Deployment: Vercel for a live demo URL.

6. Engagement Terms
Work Hours: I will use the Upwork Desktop App for transparent, automatic time tracking. You will have full visibility into all logged hours and activity.
Communication: Regular updates will be provided via Upwork Messages (daily check-ins and weekly summaries).
Billing: You will be billed weekly through Upwork for the hours logged in the previous week.
Scope Management: The 30-35 day timeline is based on the described MVP scope. Any significant changes or additional feature requests will be discussed beforehand, as they may impact the timeline and total hours required.
